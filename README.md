# Agriculture
A website to invest and sell your crops

# Problem Statement
Agricultural marketing still continues to be in a bad shape in rural India. In the absence proper facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price.
Due to the presence of unorganized marketing structure, private traders and middlemen dominate the marketing and trading of agricultural produce.

# Solution
* We have come up with a way in which a company/investor can directly communicate with a small/big farmer for the supply agricultural goods as per their requirement. 
* We have created a platform in which a farmer can get updates regarding different investors who are interested in buying their crops and are ready to invest in there land
* By doing this, it will bring about the transfer of technical skills in a way that is profitable for both the sponsors and farmers. 
* They can also sign a contract where both the farmer and investor agree on some terms and conditions. It is a simple and practical legal tool for buyers and producers to make responsible agricultural investment a reality.
* All the data of the details of the contract is handled by using the concept of blockchain. Therefore all the data from the contract would be 100% secure and both of them would have to abide by it.
